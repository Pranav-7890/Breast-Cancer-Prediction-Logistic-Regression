# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous) based on cell measurements. 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 569 instances with 30 features (radius, texture, perimeter, etc.). 
- **Target Labels:** 0 (Malignant), 1 (Benign).

## 🚀 Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed irrelevant columns (ID) and handled missing values.
2. **EDA:** Analyzed the distribution of classes and statistical summaries.
3. **Preprocessing:** Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. **Modeling:** Trained a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluation:** Achieved high accuracy on both training and test data.

## 📈 Results
- **Training Accuracy:** ~97%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~93%

## 💻 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Upload the `Breast_Cancer_Data.csv` file.
3. Run the `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
